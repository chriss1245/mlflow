# Scikit-learn ElasticNet Diabetes Example

Note: A minimum MLflow version of 1.0 is required to run this example.

This example trains an ElasticNet regression model for predicting diabetes progression. The example uses [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), which requires different Python dependencies for Linux and OSX. The [linux](linux) and [osx](osx) subdirectories include appropriate MLflow projects for each respective platform.
